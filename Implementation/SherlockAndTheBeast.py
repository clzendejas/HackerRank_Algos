""" Sherlock and the Beast:

    Sherlock Holmes suspects his archenemy, Professor Moriarty, is once again
    plotting something diabolical. Sherlock's companion, Dr. Watson, suggests
    Moriarty may be responsible for MI6's recent issues with their
    supercomputer, The Beast.

    Shortly after resolving to investigate, Sherlock receives a note from
    Moriarty boasting about infecting The Beast with a virus; however,
    he also gives him a clueâ€”a number, N. Sherlock determines the key to
    removing the virus is to find the largest Decent Number having N digits.

    A Decent Number has the following properties:

    1. Its digits can only be 3's and/or 5's.
    2. The number of 3's it contains is divisible by 5.
    3. The number of 5's it contains is divisible by 3.

    Inputs:
    - line 1: an integer T (number of Test cases)
    - for each T test cases:
        - An integer N (number of digits in the number)

    Output:
    - Print the largest decent number having N digits, if no such number
      exists, print -1
